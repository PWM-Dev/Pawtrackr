//
//  Drives the interactive, step-by-step product tour. The tour is a catalog
//  of stops that walks the app screen by screen, in one fixed order:
//  Dashboard, Clients, client details and checkout, Insights, Settings. The
//  stops are grouped into lessons. A role decides which lessons and some
//  coach tips, never the order. What the store and device hold
//  (`WalkthroughTourContext`) decides which stops apply and how they read,
//  and saved progress (`WalkthroughProgress`) lets the tour continue where
//  it stopped or replay a single lesson.
